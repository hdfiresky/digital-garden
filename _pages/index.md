# Welcome to My Digital Garden

This is a space where I cultivate my thoughts, learnings, and ideas in technology. It's a collection of interconnected notes, constantly growing and evolving.

Unlike a traditional blog, these notes are not chronological. They are organized by topic and linked together to form a web of knowledge. This approach, inspired by the Zettelkasten method, helps in discovering new connections and building a deeper understanding.

## How to Navigate

- Use the sidebar to browse through all available notes.
- Click on any `[[wikilink]]` within a note to jump to a related topic.
- Check the "Backlinks" section at the bottom of each note to see which other notes refer to it.

This garden is built with React and Tailwind CSS, and it's a living project. Feel free to explore!
