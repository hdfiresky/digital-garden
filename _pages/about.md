# About This Garden

This digital garden is a personal project by a passionate frontend engineer. It serves as a public notebook, a place to document what I'm learning, and a tool for "learning in public."

## The Philosophy

The core idea is to move away from polished, perfect articles and embrace a more fluid, work-in-progress approach. Notes are atomic, covering a single concept, and are richly interlinked. This creates a non-linear, exploratory experience.

- **Interconnected:** Knowledge isn't linear. By linking notes, we can better represent the complex relationships between ideas.
- **Evergreen:** Notes are meant to be updated and refined over time as my understanding grows.
- **Accessible:** By making my notes public, I hope to share my journey and perhaps help others who are learning the same things.

## Technology Stack

- **Framework:** React 18
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
- **Routing:** React Router (HashRouter)
- **Markdown:** react-markdown

This project itself is an exercise in applying some of the concepts discussed in the notes, such as [[react-hooks]] and creating reusable components.
