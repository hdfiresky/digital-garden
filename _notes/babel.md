# Babel

Babel is a free and open-source JavaScript transcompiler that is mainly used to convert ECMAScript 2015+ (ES6+) code into a backwards compatible version of JavaScript that can be run by older JavaScript engines.

## How it works

Babel uses plugins to transform syntax. For example, a plugin can transform ES6 arrow functions into regular function expressions. Presets are collections of plugins.

It is an essential tool for frontend development, allowing developers to use the latest JavaScript features while maintaining broad browser compatibility. It's almost always used in conjunction with a bundler like [[webpack]].
