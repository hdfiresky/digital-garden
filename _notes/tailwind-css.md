# Tailwind CSS

Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces.

## Philosophy

Instead of providing pre-styled components (like Bootstrap), Tailwind provides low-level utility classes that let you build completely custom designs without ever leaving your HTML.

For example, instead of `.card`, you'd use classes like `bg-white rounded-lg shadow-md p-4`.

This approach avoids many of the pitfalls of traditional CSS, like naming conventions and specificity wars. It's an alternative to [[css-in-js]]. This very digital garden is styled with Tailwind!
