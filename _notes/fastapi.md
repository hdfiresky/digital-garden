# FastAPI

FastAPI is a modern, high-performance web framework for building APIs with [[python]] 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints.

## Key Features

- **Fast:** Very high performance, on par with NodeJS and Go (thanks to Starlette and Pydantic).
- **Automatic Docs:** Interactive API documentation (Swagger UI and ReDoc) is generated automatically.
- **Type Hints:** Uses Python type hints for data validation, serialization, and documentation.

FastAPI is an excellent choice for building [[rest-apis]] and is gaining popularity rapidly. It offers a great developer experience compared to [[flask]].
