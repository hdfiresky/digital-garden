# GraphQL

GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data. It was developed by Facebook.

## Key Differences from REST

- **Declarative Data Fetching:** The client specifies exactly what data it needs.
- **Single Endpoint:** Typically, a GraphQL API has a single endpoint, unlike [[rest-apis]] which have many.
- **No Over-fetching or Under-fetching:** You get exactly the data you asked for, in a single request.

GraphQL provides a more efficient, powerful, and flexible alternative to REST.
