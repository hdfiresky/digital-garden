# Docker

Docker is a set of platform-as-a-service products that use OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers.

## Why use Docker?

- **Consistency:** Containers package up an application with all of its dependencies, ensuring it runs the same way in any environment.
- **Isolation:** Containers isolate applications from one another and from the underlying infrastructure.
- **Portability:** Docker containers can run on any machine that has Docker installed.

Docker is a foundational technology for [[microservices]] and is often managed at scale using [[kubernetes]].
