# JavaScript

JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language with first-class functions. It is the programming language of the Web.

## Core Features

- **Dynamic Typing:** Types are checked at runtime. Compare with [[typescript]].
- **Prototype-based:** Objects inherit from other objects.
- **Event-driven:** Asynchronous operations are common, using callbacks, promises, and async/await.

JavaScript is the foundation of many modern web technologies, including [[react]]. Transpilers like [[babel]] are often used to write modern JS while maintaining browser compatibility.
