# TypeScript

TypeScript is a free and open-source high-level programming language developed by Microsoft that adds static typing with optional type annotations to [[javascript]].

## Advantages over JavaScript

- **Static Typing:** Catch errors during development, before the code is run.
- **Better Tooling:** Enhanced autocompletion, navigation, and refactoring in code editors.
- **Readability:** Type annotations can make code easier to understand.

TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, which means any valid JavaScript code is also valid TypeScript code. It is highly recommended for large-scale applications, including those built with [[react]].
