# Git

Git is a distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.

## Core Concepts

- **Repository:** A collection of files and the history of their changes.
- **Commit:** A snapshot of your repository at a specific point in time.
- **Branch:** A parallel version of your repository.
- **Merge:** The process of combining changes from different branches.

Git is an essential tool for modern software development and is a key part of [[ci-cd]] pipelines.
