# Kubernetes

Kubernetes (K8s) is an open-source container orchestration system for automating software deployment, scaling, and management.

## Key Features

- **Container Orchestration:** Manages the lifecycle of containers, such as those created with [[docker]].
- **Scalability:** Automatically scales applications up or down based on demand.
- **Self-healing:** Restarts containers that fail, replaces and reschedules containers when nodes die.

Kubernetes is the de-facto standard for deploying containerized applications at scale and is a core component of modern [[ci-cd]] infrastructure.
