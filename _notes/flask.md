# Flask

Flask is a micro web framework written in [[python]]. It is classified as a microframework because it does not require particular tools or libraries.

## Philosophy

- **Minimalist:** Flask provides the basics: routing, request handling, and templating. Everything else is up to the developer.
- **Extensible:** A large ecosystem of extensions is available to add functionality like database integration, authentication, etc.

Flask is a great choice for smaller projects, APIs, or when you want more control over the components you use. It's often used as a starting point for building [[microservices]]. Compare it with [[fastapi]].
