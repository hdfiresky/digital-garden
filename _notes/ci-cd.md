# CI/CD

CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery/Deployment. It's a practice in software development that aims to automate the software release process.

## Continuous Integration (CI)

CI is the practice of merging all developer working copies to a shared mainline several times a day. Each merge is then verified by an automated build and test sequence. Tools like [[git]] are fundamental to this process.

## Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CD)

CD is the practice of automatically deploying code to production or a staging environment once it passes the CI phase. This is often done using tools like [[docker]] and [[kubernetes]].
