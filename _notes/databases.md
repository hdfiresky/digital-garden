# Databases

A database is an organized collection of data, generally stored and accessed electronically from a computer system.

## Types of Databases

There are two main categories of databases:

- **Relational Databases ([[sql]]):** Data is stored in tables with a predefined schema. Examples include PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQLite.
- **Non-Relational Databases ([[nosql]]):** Data can be stored in various formats like document, key-value, or graph. Examples include MongoDB, Redis, and Neo4j.

Frameworks like [[django]] provide an ORM to abstract away the differences between various SQL databases.
