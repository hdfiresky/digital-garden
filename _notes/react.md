# React

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies.

React can be used as a base in the development of single-page or mobile applications.

## Core Concepts

- **Components:** React is all about building encapsulated components that manage their own state.
- **JSX:** A syntax extension to JavaScript that looks similar to HTML.
- **Virtual DOM:** React uses a [[virtual-dom]] to efficiently update and render the right components when your data changes.

## Important Hooks

- `useState`: For managing local component state. See [[react-hooks]].
- `useEffect`: For handling side effects.
- `useContext`: For accessing context.

React promotes a one-way data flow, which makes applications easier to reason about. For complex state, you might use a state management library like [[state-management]].
