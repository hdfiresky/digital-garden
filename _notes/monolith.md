# Monolith

A monolithic architecture is a traditional model of a software program, which is built as a single, unified unit.

## Characteristics

- **Single Codebase:** All the application's logic is in a single codebase.
- **Single Deployment Unit:** The entire application is deployed as one piece.
- **Tightly Coupled:** Components are highly dependent on each other.

Frameworks like [[django]] are often used to build monolithic applications. While the industry has shifted towards [[microservices]], monoliths can be simpler to develop and deploy, especially for smaller projects.
