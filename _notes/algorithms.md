# Algorithms

An algorithm is a finite sequence of well-defined, computer-implementable instructions, typically to solve a class of problems or to perform a computation.

## Categories of Algorithms

- **Sorting Algorithms:** (e.g., Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort)
- **Searching Algorithms:** (e.g., Linear Search, Binary Search)
- **Graph Algorithms:** (e.g., Dijkstra's Algorithm, BFS, DFS)

The efficiency of an algorithm is often analyzed in terms of its time complexity and space complexity. Strong knowledge of [[data-structures]] is essential for designing effective algorithms.
