# Clean Code

Clean Code is code that is easy to understand, easy to change, and has been written by someone who cares. The term was popularized by Robert C. Martin's book "Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship."

## Principles

- **Meaningful Names:** Variables, functions, and classes should have names that reveal their intention.
- **Small Functions:** Functions should be small and do one thing.
- **Comments are a last resort:** Code should be self-documenting.
- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself):** Avoid duplication.

Writing clean code involves applying principles from [[design-patterns]] and a solid understanding of fundamentals like [[data-structures]].
