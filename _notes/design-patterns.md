# Design Patterns

In software engineering, a design pattern is a general, reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given context in software design.

## Categories

- **Creational Patterns:** (e.g., Singleton, Factory) Provide ways to create objects.
- **Structural Patterns:** (e.g., Adapter, Decorator) Explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures.
- **Behavioral Patterns:** (e.g., Observer, Strategy) Concerned with communication between objects.

Understanding design patterns helps in writing maintainable and scalable code, which is a key principle of [[clean-code]].
