# Django

Django is a high-level [[python]] web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design.

## Features

- **Batteries-included:** Django comes with an admin interface, an ORM, authentication, and more, right out of the box.
- **ORM:** The Object-Relational Mapper allows you to interact with your [[databases]] using Python code instead of SQL.
- **Security:** Django provides built-in protection against common security threats like CSRF and XSS.

Django follows the Model-View-Template (MVT) architectural pattern. It's a great choice for building large, content-heavy web applications. It is often considered a [[monolith]] framework.
