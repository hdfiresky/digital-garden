# Authentication

Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or system. It answers the question, "Who are you?".

## Common Methods

- **Username/Password:** The most common method.
- **OAuth / OpenID Connect:** Delegated authentication, allowing users to log in with services like Google or Facebook.
- **JSON Web Tokens (JWT):** A compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties.
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Requires more than one method of authentication.

Authentication is often paired with **Authorization**, which determines what an authenticated user is allowed to do.
