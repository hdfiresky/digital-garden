# Data Structures

In computer science, a data structure is a data organization, management, and storage format that enables efficient access and modification.

## Common Data Structures

- **Arrays:** A collection of items stored at contiguous memory locations.
- **Linked Lists:** A linear collection of data elements whose order is not given by their physical placement in memory.
- **Stacks:** A LIFO (Last-In, First-Out) structure.
- **Queues:** A FIFO (First-In, First-Out) structure.
- **Trees:** A hierarchical structure.
- **Graphs:** A set of nodes connected by edges.

Understanding data structures is fundamental to writing efficient [[algorithms]] and is a core part of [[clean-code]].
