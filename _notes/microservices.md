# Microservices

Microservices is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of small, autonomous services, modeled around a business domain.

## Advantages

- **Independently Deployable:** Each service can be deployed independently of others.
- **Technology Diversity:** Each service can be written in a different programming language. (e.g., one in [[python]], another in Go).
- **Resilience:** Failure in one service does not necessarily bring down the entire application.

This approach is the opposite of a [[monolith]] architecture. Tools like [[docker]] and [[kubernetes]] are essential for managing a microservices architecture.
